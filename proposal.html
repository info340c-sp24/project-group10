        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
          The users of the application are college music fans/listeners, who
          intend to find new music based on an emotion-based algorithm. As
          stated above, music can play a strong role in influencing emotion, so
          thus those looking for music based on this can utilize our
          application. This application is inclusive and seeks to improve the
          mental health of all users to utilize it, therefore minority groups
          could also benefit from our app to reduce stress and relax.
          <br />
          <br />
          One of our features will allow the user to input multiple songs, and
          then it will analyze the emotion of such songs, and then input more
          song recommendations of a similar emotion theme. Another feature will
          be the option for the user to input a specific emotion from a list,
          and then recommend songs based on that inputted emotion. The last
          feature will be an option to order the outputted songs based on
          different factors, such as alphabetical order, or by other factors.
          The users will be able to access song information based on their input
          and preferences.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our application will be using
          <a href="https://api.spotify.com">Spotify API</a> to provide more
          specific song recommendations and a better user experience. Using the
          different Spotify metrics such as song “danceability”, tempo, and
          “key”, the app will be able to analyze song emotion and recommend
          songs based on this.
          <br />
          <br />
          This application could assist college music fans in reaping the
          benefits of how different emotions of music can accommodate one's
          emotions and mental health. By providing users with songs with similar
          moods to those they have input, as well as recommending songs that
          align with their preferences, our application could contribute to
          enhancing emotional status and mental health.
