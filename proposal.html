        <p>Our topic of interest is providing users with more customizable and personalized services on digital music streaming platforms to create more social connections, reduce stress, and improve mental health. (Fink) The problem stems from the generic approach that streaming services take towards music recommendations. We believe an individualâ€™s emotional state should be a key factor in determining the music they listen to at that moment, something that existing services tend to overlook. Music has a profound impact on emotions, capable of reducing stress and improving mental health, yet current platforms do not fully leverage this potential. Our target audience will be college students who frequently use streaming services. As college students tend to be under high mental pressure due to coursework, financial status, relationships, and other factors, it would be necessary to address these problems. (Flannery) A potential information technology problem in music streaming services is metadata errors. There will often be incorrect or mismatched labels for song information. The errors could be mislabeled in artist, song length, title, bpm, or more specified categories, leading to incorrect song recommendations and searching errors for users. To reduce student stress, there are already attempts to improve mood and regulate emotions such as gaming services, social media, and mental health advisers. While these methods might be somewhat effective, they often lack accessibility, may not provide a safe and welcoming environment, and unlike our idea, do not consider the user's emotional state, which we believe is crucial for truly enhancing the experience.
