      <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
      <!-- Problem/Data Domain -->
      <section>
        <p>Our topic of interest is providing users with more customizable and personalized services on digital music streaming platforms to create more social connections, reduce stress, and improve mental health. (Fink) The problem stems from the generic approach that streaming services take towards music recommendations. We believe an individual’s emotional state should be a key factor in determining the music they listen to at that moment, something that existing services tend to overlook. Music has a profound impact on emotions, capable of reducing stress and improving mental health, yet current platforms do not fully leverage this potential. Our target audience will be college students who frequently use streaming services. As college students tend to be under high mental pressure due to coursework, financial status, relationships, and other factors, it would be necessary to address these problems. (Flannery) A potential information technology problem in music streaming services is metadata errors. There will often be incorrect or mismatched labels for song information. The errors could be mislabeled in artist, song length, title, bpm, or more specified categories, leading to incorrect song recommendations and searching errors for users. To reduce student stress, there are already attempts to improve mood and regulate emotions such as gaming services, social media, and mental health advisers. While these methods might be somewhat effective, they often lack accessibility, may not provide a safe and welcoming environment, and unlike our idea, do not consider the user's emotional state, which we believe is crucial for truly enhancing the experience.

      <!-- App Description -->
      <section>
        <p>The users of the application are college music fans/listeners, who intend to find new music based on an emotion-based algorithm. As stated above, music can play a strong role in influencing emotion, so thus those looking for music based on this can utilize our application. This application is inclusive and seeks to improve the mental health of all users to utilize it, therefore minority groups could also benefit from our app to reduce stress and relax. 
          One of our features will allow the user to input multiple songs, and then it will analyze the emotion of such songs, and then input more song recommendations of a similar emotion theme. Another feature will be the option for the user to input a specific emotion from a list, and then recommend songs based on that inputted emotion. The last feature will be an option to order the outputted songs based on different factors, such as alphabetical order, or by other factors.
          The users will be able to access song information based on their input and preferences. Our application will be using Spotify API to provide more specific song recommendations and a better user experience. Link: https://api.spotify.com Using the different Spotify metrics such as song “danceability”, tempo, and “key”, the app will be able to analyze song emotion and recommend songs based on this. This application could assist college music fans in reaping the benefits of how different emotions of music can accommodate one's emotions and mental health. By providing users with songs with similar moods to those they have input, as well as recommending songs that align with their preferences, our application could contribute to enhancing emotional status and mental health.
